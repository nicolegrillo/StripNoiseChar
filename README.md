# Strip-noise-characterization

Strip noise analysis and characterisation for my thesis project (winter 2022).
This repository works as a storage for the functions and codes that help find some useful Strip parameters that characterize the noise.

# Noise characterization
The Python script $\texttt{noise_evaluation.py}$ finds the optimal parameters for the noise curve in the Fourier space, with two different methods. It returns a report file complete with data graphs and printed results.

It can be called 

# Error data plots


# Cross correlation
